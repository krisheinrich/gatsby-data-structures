## Introduction

An **Array** is an ordered collection of items stored in a _contiguous block of memory_ and accessed via an _index_, which acts as an offset from the base address of the array.

In many languages, arrays are **static** by default, meaning their size must be specified at the point the array is declared and cannot be resized. Instead, when the array needs to extend beyond its original bounds, a new block of memory with a bigger size must be allocated and each of the elements in the original array copied into this new larger array. Many languages also provide a built-in data type that implements a **dynamic** array, which the programmer need not worry about resizing manually; any resizing that does occur is hidden from the user.


## When to Use

- Note: specific method names are language-depenedent.

- Lookup Tables


## Associated Abstract Data Types

- List
- Heap

## Runtime complexity of Array Oprations

- lookup: O(1)
- add to back: O(1)
- add to front: O(n)
- remove from back (pop): O(1)
- remove from front: O(n)

## Examples

```javascript
const data = [];
```
