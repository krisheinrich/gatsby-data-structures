# Welcome to the Algorithms and Data Structures site!

## Motivation

I wanted a website that had excellent information but was also accessible and easy-to-use for beginners just getting acquainted with Data Structures and Algorithms. Many online resources assume at least some prior knowledge of the material, and often the sources with the clearest information are the least visually appealing. This site is an attempt to remedy this situation.

## Who Is This Site For

Anyone wanting a clear, concise, and definitive guide to the most common types of Data Structures, Abstract Data Types, and Algorithms.

To get started, check out the <GatsbyLink to='/overview'>Overview</GatsbyLink> to get a sense of what this site is all about, or browse the available <GatsbyLink to='/structures'>Data Structures</GatsbyLink> or <GatsbyLink to='/algorithms'>Algorithms</GatsbyLink> for more information on a particular topic.
