import { Link as GatsbyLink } from 'gatsby';

## Motivation

I wanted a website that had excellent information but was also accessible and easy-to-use for beginners just getting acquainted with Data Structures and Algorithms, since many only resources assume at least some prior knowledge.

## Who Is This Site For

Anyone wanting a clear, concise, and definitive guide to the most common types of Data Structures, Abstract Data Types, and Algorithms.
