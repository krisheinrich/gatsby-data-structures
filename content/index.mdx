# Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms site!


## Why Study Data Structures and Algorithms?

**Algorithms**, formalized procedures for accomplishing some task, are important for the problem solving power they bestow on those who study them. For simple programming problems, often the most obvious or "naive" approach, such as a _linear scan_ of some data, serves as a suffiencient solution. In these cases it is not necessary to reach for a more sophisticated algorithm. However, for more complex problems, there may not be an obvious approach, or such an approach may require so much computational time and space that it becomes infeasible in practice, e.g. if the data set that needs to be processed is extremely large.

A good algorithm can literally find a solution in _under one second_ to a problem that would take a naive algorithm _thousands of years_ to solve, even on the most cutting-edge hardware available. Some examples include finding the shortest route between two locations, determining an optimal assignment of students to classes given their graduation requirements and preferences, or identifying the similarities and differences between two text files. Knowledge of algorithms and algorithmic analysis is crucial for developing correct and efficient solutions to these types of problems.

Algorithms are often designed around particular **data structures**, arrangements of data into some coherent organization. 

Algorithms and data structures are often the focus of technical interviews for software engineer/developer jobs, so there are very practical reasons to study these topics as well.


## Motivation For This Site

I wanted a website that had excellent information but was also accessible and easy-to-use for beginners just getting acquainted with Data Structures and Algorithms. Many online resources assume at least some prior knowledge of the material, and often the sources with the clearest information are the least visually appealing. This site is an attempt to remedy this situation.


## Who Is This Site For?

Anyone wanting a clear, concise, and definitive guide to the most common types of Data Structures, Abstract Data Types, and Algorithms.

To get started, check out the <GatsbyLink to='/overview'>Overview</GatsbyLink> to get a sense of what this site is all about, or browse the available <GatsbyLink to='/structures'>Data Structures</GatsbyLink> or <GatsbyLink to='/algorithms'>Algorithms</GatsbyLink> for more information on a particular topic.
