## Introduction

An **algorithm** is an explicitly-defined procedure (set of computer instructions) for accomplishing some task. The approach one takes to accomplish a given goal is largely determined by how the data is organized, i.e. what <GatsbyLink to='/structures'>data structure</GatsbyLink> employed to store the data.

Algorithms may be described in pseudo-code or in any actual computer language capable of performing the instructions included in the algorithm.

Algorithms often make use of a generalizable approach to problem solving, such as _Divide and Conquer_ or _backtracking_. These general approaches are known as **algorithmic paradigms** and can be use to solve problems in many other domains, not just compuetr science.

Algorithms may be loosely classified along the lines of the data structure or abstract data type they correspond to.
