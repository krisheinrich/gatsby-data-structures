## Introduction

An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a theoretical model of a data structure. A **Data Structure** is a particular way of organizing data within program memory. Data structures are closely related to **<GatsbyLink to='/adts'>Abstract Data Types (ADT)</GatsbyLink>**: they provide an implementation which enables a particular set of operations (typically defined by an ADT) to be performed.

See <GatsbyLink to='/adts'>Abstract Data Types</GatsbyLink> and <GatsbyLink to='/structures'>Data Structures</GatsbyLink> for more information.
