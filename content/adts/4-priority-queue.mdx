## Introduction

A **Priority Queue** is an ordered set of items which allows retrival based on assigned priority. Elements with higher priority are retrieved first. Unlike a queue or stack, the order in which elements in a priority queue are accessed is not determined by the order in which they were added.

A **Double-Ended Priority Queue** (**DEPQ**) is an enhanced priority queue that allows efficient retrieval of either the max- or min-priority element.
