## Introduction - TODO

A **Graph** is...

Graphs may be **directed** or **undirected**, depending on whether the edges are unidirectional or bidirectional. Directed graphs are often called **digraphs**.

A **connected** graph is one which in which there exists at least one path between every pair of vertices, i.e. no vertex is _unreachable_. A **disconnected** graph contains at least one unreachable vertex.

Graphs may also be **cyclic** or **acyclic**, depending on whether there exists one or more cycles within the graph.

Undirected graphs are comprised of **(connected) components**, which are subgraphs in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths. Digraphs are partitionable into conceptually related structures called **strongly-connected components** (or simply **strong components**), in which every vertex is reachable from every other vertex within the subgraph.
