A solid understanding of data structures and algorithms is fundamental to real-world programming.

This section provides a brief introduction to the material contained in this site.
- <GatsbyLink to='/overview/adts-vs-structures'>ADTs vs Data Structures</GatsbyLink> explains the difference between data structures and their associated abstract data types.
- <GatsbyLink to='/overview/algorithm-analysis'>Algorithm Analysis</GatsbyLink> introduces the methods of measure algorithm performance, i.e. time- and space-complexity, and provides a guide for assessing the fitness of an algorithm for a given application.
